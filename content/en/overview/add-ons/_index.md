## Trellis Images

Automatically create WebP versions of your existing legacy images and swap them out on-the-fly. When a user visits a post that includes a legacy image, Trellis Images passes it on to Mediavine’s image processing service (included free in your Trellis subscription). When done, a WebP version of the image is sent back to your site and stored in the uploads directory (the original image is never altered or removed). 

The next time a visitor lands on the page, they’ll be served the WebP version instead. WebP lossless images are smaller than equivalent PNGs and JPEGs, and are preferred by Google. See the [WebP site](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp) for more information.

Trellis Images is an optional plugin included with your purchase. If you already create WebP images as part of your workflow (or prefer a different plugin), you don’t need to install Trellis Images.
